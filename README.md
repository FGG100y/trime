## About

Trime is originally a frontend of open-source [Android Traditional Chinese IME], based on [RIME] input method framework and written in Java/Kotlin with JNI. It is designed to protect the native language of various local dialects of Chinese and is a universal shape-based and phonetic-based input method platform.

## Local voice input (this fork)

> Fork-only work in progress on `feature/on-device-voice-input`, not part of
> upstream Trime yet. Design and implementation notes:
> [`doc/voice-input.md`](doc/voice-input.md).

This branch adds optional, **fully on-device** voice input: long press the space
bar, speak, and each finished utterance is inserted at the cursor as you pause.
Audio never leaves the phone, and the app still does not request `INTERNET`.

Instead of following the build and import steps by hand, you can hand the whole
job to a coding agent (Claude Code, Codex, pi, ...). Copy this prompt as-is:

```text
Please set Trime up with on-device voice input on my phone:

1. clone https://github.com/FGG100y/trime and check out the
   feature/on-device-voice-input branch
2. run script/fetch-sherpa-onnx.sh, then build the debug APK with
   BUILD_ABI=arm64-v8a (do not build armeabi-v7a, it currently fails)
3. adb install -r the debug APK (com.osfans.trime.debug)
4. optionally unpack a speech model under /sdcard/Download for me
5. then hand me a checklist of everything only I can do on the phone

Constraint: use adb only on this app (install / launch / logcat / screenshot).
Do not tap around other apps or system settings, and do not perform actions on
my device for me - write the steps down and I will run them.
```

### What the agent can do on its own

- Fetch the prebuilt native library and build: `script/fetch-sherpa-onnx.sh`,
  then `BUILD_ABI=arm64-v8a ./gradlew :app:assembleDebug` (the ~240 KB API jar is
  committed so a clean checkout compiles; the ~30 MB `.so` files are not).
- Install over adb and stream this IME's own logs while you try it.
- Download and unpack a model to shared storage, so the import step is quick.

### What only you can do (ask the agent for this checklist)

| Step | Where |
| --- | --- |
| Enable and select "Trime (debug)" | System settings → Languages & input (an IME can only be enabled by the user) |
| Grant the microphone permission | The dialog shown on the first long press of space |
| Import the model (pick the model **folder** in the system picker) | Trime Settings → *Local voice input* → Import model |
| Set *Long press space* to *Local voice input* | Trime Settings → *Local voice input* (also on the General page) |
| Deploy Rime once, so `t9.prism.bin` and friends are built | Trime main screen → **Deploy** (only if you also use the companion left-handed t9 config, see below) |

Recommended model: **SenseVoiceSmall**
([`sherpa-onnx-sense-voice-zh-en-ja-ko-yue-int8-2024-07-17`](https://github.com/k2-fsa/sherpa-onnx/releases/download/asr-models/sherpa-onnx-sense-voice-zh-en-ja-ko-yue-int8-2024-07-17.tar.bz2),
~230 MB, good Chinese, punctuates out of the box). Other supported layouts,
storage/RAM baseline and the release-name traps are in
[`doc/voice-input.md`](doc/voice-input.md).

### The keyboard side

The left-handed 九宫格 layout this build is used with (`t9` / `t9_en`, long-press
space bound to voice) lives in a separate repo, **trime-config**
(`git@github.com:FGG100y/trime-config.git`, currently private); its README covers
`script/push.sh` and the *Deploy* step. With a stock upstream APK you only get the "system voice input method"
option, not the local engine.

## History

TRIME is the abbreviation of _Tongwen RIME_ or _ThaeRv Input Method_.

From the beginning, TRIME was written for TaeRv Pinyin, and named _TaeRv Input Method (泰如输入法)_.

Then, we created an input method platform with some code tables, such as Wu dialect (吴语). We renamed it to _Chinese Character Dialect Input Method (汉字方言输入法)_.

Later, it supports Wubi and Liangbi and other shape-based input method, we branded it [_Tongwen Input Method Platform 2.0 (同文输入法平台 2.0)_](https://github.com/osfans/trime-legacy), which implies that the phonetic-based and shape-based input method on one platform, while dialects and Mandrain share one kind of characters.

Benefit from the [librime](https://github.com/rime/librime) project by JNI, we are now in version 3.0 of TRIME aka _Tongwen Input Method (同文输入法)_.

## Getting Started for developer

### Prepare

#### Requirements:

- Android SDK and Android NDK
  * If you are new to Android development, please install [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio).

- JDK (OpenJDK) 17
- Python 3 (required by OpenCC to generate dictionary text files)

#### Prerequisites for Windows

Symbolic links will be created according to current build configurations, developers need:

- Enable [Developer Mode](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/get-started/enable-your-device-for-development) so that symlinks can be created without administrator privilege.

- Enable symlink support for `git`:

  ```powershell
  git config --global core.symlinks true
  ```

If you cannot or wouldn't like to enable anything, it doesn't matter. Copying will be used instead when error on creating symbolic links.

### Build

#### 1. Clone this project and fetch all submodules:

```sh
git clone git@github.com:osfans/trime.git
git submodule update --init --recursive
# use partial clone to save time
git submodule update --init --recursive --filter=blob:none
```

#### 2. Debug version without signature:

```sh
# On Linux or macOS
make debug

# On Windows
.\gradlew assembleDebug
```

#### 3. Release version with signture:

Create `keystore.properties` file which contains following contents for [signing information](https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/app-signing.html):

```gradle.properties
storePassword=myStorePassword
keyPassword=mykeyPassword
keyAlias=myKeyAlias
storeFile=myStoreFileLocation
```

Then, you may run:

```sh
# On Linux or macOS
make release

# On Windows
.\gradlew assembleRelease
```

### Troubleshooting

```
Target "boost_log_setup" links to target "Boost::coroutine" but the target was not found.
```

Run `make clean` on Linux or macOS, or run `.\gradlew clean` on Windows.

Other issues:

1. Try `make clean`
2. Make sure your repo is up-to-date. If one or more submodules are modified, also make sure they are compatible with the current version.
3. If the problem still exists(very unlikely), try to make a new clone.
4. Check if this is there is an issue/PR related to your problem. If yes, try their solutions.
5. If none of them works, you may make an issue to ask for help.(optional)
